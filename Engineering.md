Design Patterns
---------------

In **software engineering**, a [**design pattern**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design (solution to a common software problem). A **design pattern** is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code.

In **software engineering**, the [**singleton pattern**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
