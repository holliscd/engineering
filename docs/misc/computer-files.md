Understanding Computer Files Data items can be stored on two broad types of storage devices in a computer system: 0 Volatile storage is temporary; values that are volatile, such as those stored in variables, are lost when a computer loses power. Random access memory (RAM) is the temporary 676 storage within a computer. When you write a java program that stores a value in a variable, you are using RAM. Most computer professionals simply call volatile storage memory.   o Nonvolatile storage is permanent storage; it is not lost when a computer loses power. When you write a Java program and save it to a disk, you are using permanent storage.
