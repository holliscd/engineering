# SEO

Search engine optimization **(SEO)** is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine's unpaid resultsâ€”often referred to as "natural," "organic," or "earned" results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users, and these visitors can be converted into customers.

## Search engines

Web search engines (like Google) automatically add new web sites to their search index every time they crawl the web.

If your web site is new and unknown, it may take some time before your site is "discovered".

Luckily most search engines invites you to submit your site: *

- [Bing](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/submit-site-url)
