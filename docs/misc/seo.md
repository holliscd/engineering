# SEO

Search engine optimization **(SEO)** is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine's unpaid resultsâ€”often referred to as "natural," "organic," or "earned" results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users, and these visitors can be converted into customers.
