# Organizing Your Files, Folders and Documents

## Rules

1. Don’t put files on the desktop
2. Limit folder creation
3. Get used to thinking in hierarchies
4. `/archive` is your friend

## Cloud

- Goolge Drive
- Dropbox

## Naming

1. Use capital letters to delimit words, not spaces: `RiscManagment.txt`
2. Keep file names short, but meaningful: `2015GlobalMarketShare.doc` 
3. Dates in the file name always state the date ‘back to front’ in format: `YYYY`, `YYYYMM`, `YYYYMMDD`. 
4. Order the elements in a most appropriate way to retrieve the record: `20140630Agenda.csv`
5. Give it as a two-digit number rather than one in file: `OrgHier2014V02.xls`
