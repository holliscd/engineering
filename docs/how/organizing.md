# Organizing Your Files, Folders and Documents

## Rules

1. Don’t put files on the desktop
2. Limit folder creation
3. Get used to thinking in **hierarchies**
4. `/archive` is your friend

## Cloud

- [Goolge Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)
- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)

## Naming

1. Use **capital letters** to delimit words, **not spaces**: `RiscManagment.txt`
2. Keep file names **short**, but **meaningful**: `2015GlobalMarketShare.doc` 
3. Dates in the file name always state the date **‘back to front’** in format: `YYYY`, `YYYYMM`, `YYYYMMDD`. 
4. Order the elements in a most appropriate way **to retrieve** the record: `20140630Agenda.csv`
5. Give it as a **two-digit** number rather than one in file: `OrgHier2014V02.xls`
