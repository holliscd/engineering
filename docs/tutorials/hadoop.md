# Hadoop

The Apache **Hadoop** software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing or computing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

## Fundamentals

[**Big Data**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) is data sets that are too large to be analyzed on single mashine, no matter how beefy that mashine is.

**Scale** comes from a variaty of factors:

- Quanity (volume) e.g. terabytes or petabytes
- Speed (velosity) e.g. streaming incoming data
- Handling (variety) e.g. many types of data

**Machine Learning** (ML) focuses on learning by example, and the more examples you have, the better the learner. Many modern applications are powered by ML algorithms that use Big Data to avoid tricky things like smoothing or sample error.

**V's of Big Data** is a probllems with distributed computing:

- Volume
- Velocity
- Variety
- Veracity
