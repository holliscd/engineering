# Python

[**Python**](https://www.python.org/) is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be not possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.

## Notes

- To validate syntax without compiling: `python -m py_compile [fime-name].py`

## Access by index

The string "PYTHON" has six characters, numbered 0 to 5, as shown below:

    +---+---+---+---+---+---+
    | P | Y | T | H | O | N |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+
      0   1   2   3   4   5

So if you wanted "Y", you could just type "PYTHON"[1] (always start counting from 0!)
