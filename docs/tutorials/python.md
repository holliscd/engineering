Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.[19][20] Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be not possible in languages such as C++ or Java.[21][22] The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.
