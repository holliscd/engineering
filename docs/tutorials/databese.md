**ACID transaction** A transaction that is *atomic*, *consistent*, *isolated*, and *durable*. An atomic transaction is one in which a set of database changes are committed as a unit; either all of them are completed or none of them are. A consistent transaction is one in which all actions are taken against rows in the same logical state. An isolated transaction is one that is protected from changes by other users. A durable transaction is one that, once committed to a database, is permanent regardless of subsequent failure. There are different levels of consistency and isolation. See transaction-level consistency and statement-level consistency. See also transaction isolation level.
